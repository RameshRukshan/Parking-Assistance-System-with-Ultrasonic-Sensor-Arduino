<h1>PARKING ASSISTANCE SYSTEM</h1>
<p>One of the common applications of ultrasonic sensors is parking assistance systems of automobiles by using an Arduino UNO board, HC-SR04 sensors, RGB LEDs and Buzzers.</p>

<p>Assume that four distance sensors are placed in the four corners of the vehicle as shown in the following diagram.</p>
<p>You have to calculate the distance from each sensor and interpret the distance by using LEDs and a buzzer as described below.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;If the distance reading is less than 3m for at least once sensor, a shot beep is generated by the buzzer and corresponding RGB LED is set to green color.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the distance reading is less than 1.5 m for at least once sensor, a long beep is generated by the buzzer and corresponding RGB LED is set to orange color.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;If the distance reading is less than 0.5 m for at least once sensor, a continuous beep is generated by the buzzer and corresponding RGB LED is set to red color.</p>
